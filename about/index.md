I am a 30-something year old data scientist working on genomics (next-generation sequencing) at the R&D site of a large medical tech company in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
I received my PhD in statistics from UC Berkeley in 2010 and my B.S degree in Cybernetics (Specialization in Bioinformatics) and Applied Mathematics at UCLA in 2004.
I grew up in Southern California and am now living in Chapel Hill, NC.

### Questions that I get asked sometimes:

> Why did you move to North Carolina?

Ask my [husband](http://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/) who happens to be a top-notch academic (probabilist) in the Statistics and Operations Research Department at UNC Chapel Hill.

> Are you Chinese?

Why yes I am.  Although please don't just start speaking to me quickly in Mandarin.  I am Chinese American; my parents immigrated to LA from Hong Kong in the 70s - I speak very poor Cantonese and can't write.  =P

> Do you have any siblings?

Yep, I have one awesome younger brother, Calvin Tong, who works at Symantec in Los Angeles and lives next to the beach(!)

> Do you own 100 or fewer things?

Heck no!  That's not possible once I factor in furniture and kitchen equipment.  Although I often dream about having all my possessions in one backpack...

> What was the last book you read?

A terrific book called [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less by Greg McKeown](http://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-The-Disciplined-Pursuit-Less/dp/0804137382).  I just finished it today (2014-09-21), and it really drove home for me the fact that I had neglected the minimalist philosophy for my work and other projects and had only pursued minimalism for the consumerist/materialism angle.  In order to be successful in my career, I need to define what is truly essential for me and to effectively plan how to accomplish those goals so that I don't overwork with no results.
