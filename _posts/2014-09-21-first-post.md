This is the first post of my new webpage.  I used to blog regularly about a decade ago on pretty lame boring things, ala dear diary style (I'm embarrassed to put the link to that blog here but if you know me pretty well, it'll be easy to find).  I hope to put much more interesting and useful information and musings on this one about my life as a data scientist and an aspiring minimalist. So see you again soon for the next real post! =)

In the meantime, please see my [About](/about/) section for some information about me.
